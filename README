This is a bot that acts as a Telegram to Email gateway. This is used to relay all messages from a group chat to email and the other way around.

To receive mail get your mail server (e.g. postfix) to execute mailpipe.py and write the mail to stdin of the python process.

For postfix you could put something like
```
mybot-forward: |/path/to/mailpipe.py
```
in /etc/aliases. Don't forget to run ```postalias /etc/aliases`` afterwards. Also make sure that mailpipe.py is executable.
